<h2>General Information</h2>

<p>
  This intensive 2-day <a href="//software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> bootcamp will introduce attendees to a range of computing skills aimed at making them more productive and efficient in their work. A substantial focus of the workshop will be on improving programming skills in R, but will also include topics on version control, using the shell, and reproducible research. Short tutorials will alternate with hands-on practical exercises. Participants will be encouraged both to help one another, and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems during and between sessions.

<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The bootcamp is targeted at postgraduate students and other researchers in Psychology. This course will cover a thorough introduction to the R language, however it is not a stats course - it is about better coding practices that one should be able to apply to different programming environments. Yet, some few basic examples on stats and plotting will be presented as case studies. If you have never used/seen R before, please don't let that scare you off - if you'd like to attend this course, working through the online material covered in <a href="http://nicercode.github.io/modules/#introduction-to-r-macquarie-university-2013">'Day 1' of the NiceR code 'Introduction to R'</a> will get you up to speed!
